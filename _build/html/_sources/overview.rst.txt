Overview
******************

The Acheron project is a group of keyboard Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) designed by Álvaro "Gondolindrim" Volpato with collaborators Felipe "MrKeebs" Gonçalves, Raphael "ArcticFox" Hochheim and Steve from WoodCables.

The aim of the project is to build a database of freely available keyboard PCBs that comply with Open-Source Hardware principles.

Codenames and standard naming
-----------------------------

Although each board has a codename to which it is commonly referred, each board in the Acheron project has a standard naming which comprises seven characteristics, which summarize each board's main features:

1. **Size**. The board size in percentage or abbreviation, e.g., 40, 50, 75, 100, WKL, (E) for ergo, (S) for split.

2. **Layout type**: staggered (S) or ortho (O).

3. **Microprocessor mounting type**. This is to differentiate between the "skeleton-type" boards I design, based on the Nori and the Gherkin. These usually use a THT platform (like the Proton C or the Pro Micro) and the components used (like diodes and LED resistors) are generally all THT. In this case, use a (TH) for "through hole". If otherwise, that is, the board has a surface-mounted microprocessor (which usually means SMD components) use (SM) for "suface-mount".

4. **Switch type:** can be (MX) for MX switches and clones, (AL) for alps switches, (KC) for kailh choc. This identifier can be a double; for instance, if the board supports both MX and Alps, use (MX/AL).

5. **Switch mount type:** hotswap (HS) or through-hole (TH).

6. **Wired**: if the keyboard is wired, use (WI). If it is a Bluetooth, use (BT).
