Overview
========

The Anubis is a 50% ortho keyboard PCB, compatible with MX switches and supporting three bottom row layouts.

This was an old idea of mine, following the ortho layout from the Shark. It was kept under the rug until a friend, Lukelex, came to me asking for a 50% ortho PCB for a case which was being designed by him and another user, Tomu.

The very same day I started working on the PCB, I found `this instragram page <https://www.instagram.com/santier.royal/>`_, belonging to Alex Sandro Honorato -- a brazilian tattoo artist -- also known as Santier Royal. The Instagram page is where he published his wonderful designs, and it's definitely worth checking out. I was immediately drawn by his Anubis sketch; once he let me use the design commercially, the PCB was promptly named the Anubis.
