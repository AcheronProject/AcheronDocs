How to read the changelog
=========================

My commits follow a little convention I like to use. The commit messages are usually concise. I use tags to describe better what the commit is about:

- [Feature] Means a new feature was added
- [Update] Means a previous feature was improved or updated
- [Fix] Means a bug was fixed

V1.0

`V1.0 <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/ElevatePCB/releases/tag/v1.0>`_ :sub:`(01/12/2019)` 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First commit. This is the first prototype version. Based on that prototype the first version of the firmware will be built.
