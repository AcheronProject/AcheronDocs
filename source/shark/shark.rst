The SharkPCB is a freely available, open-source 40% keyboard Printed Circuit Board (PCB) supporting three layouts: full grid, 1x2U spacebar and 2x2U spacebar. All resources and software used to design this board are open-source and/or freely available.

Here's a list of the board's features:

- ARM Cortex M4-based STM32F303 processor;

- QMK firmware compatible;

- USBC type connector;

- RGB underglow through intelligent integrated controller WS2812B LEDs;

- Three layout support: full-grid (FG), 1 centered spacebar (1S) and double spacebar (2S);

- Rotary encoder support;

- Hardware reset through a push button and reset network;

- Overcurrent and overvoltage input protection through a fuse and schottky diode;

- Electrical Static Discharge (ESD) protection through a discharge net.

Additionally, plate gerber files are also available so that the user can order them made from the same manufacturer as the PCBs and out of the same material (FR4, a fiberglass enhanced resin laminate). This makes production cheaper and faster.

There are four plate designs available: one for each supported layout and a universal one that supports all three of them.
