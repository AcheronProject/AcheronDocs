Overview
******************

The **Acheron Project** is a group of keyboard Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) designed by √Ålvaro "Gondolindrim" Volpato with collaborators.

The aim of the project is to build a database of freely available keyboard PCBs that comply with Open-Source Hardware principles. Many features, characteristics, components are community-driven and feedback is highly appreciated.

Codenames and standard naming
-----------------------------

Although each board has a codename to which it is commonly referred, each board in the Acheron project has a standard naming which comprises seven characteristics, which summarize each board's main features:

1. **Size**. The board size in percentage or abbreviation, e.g., 40, 50, 75, 100, WKL, (E) for ergo, (S) for split.

2. **Layout type**: staggered (S) or ortho (O).

3. **Microprocessor mounting type**. This is to differentiate between the "skeleton-type" boards I design, based on the Nori and the Gherkin. These usually use a THT platform (like the Proton C or the Pro Micro) and the components used (like diodes and LED resistors) are generally all THT. In this case, use a (TH) for "through hole". If otherwise, that is, the board has a surface-mounted microprocessor (which usually means SMD components) use (SM) for "suface-mount".

4. **Switch type:** can be (MX) for MX switches and clones, (AL) for alps switches, (KC) for kailh choc. This identifier can be a double; for instance, if the board supports both MX and Alps, use (MX/AL).

5. **Switch mount type:** hotswap (HS) or through-hole (TH).

6. **Wired**: if the keyboard is wired, use (WI). If it is a Bluetooth, use (BT).
