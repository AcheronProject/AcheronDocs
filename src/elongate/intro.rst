Overview
========

The Elongate is a personal project of MrKeebs, and the PCB is a joint project between him and me. It features a very straightforward 50% staggered layout (basically a 40% with numpad).

Features
========

The ElongatePCB is a freely available, open-source 50% keyboard Printed Circuit Board (PCB) supporting a single layout, consisting of a 40% staggered layout with split spacebar. Here's a list of the board's features:

- AVR ATMEGA32U4 processor;

- QMK firmware compatible;

- USBC type connector;

- No LEDs whatsoever;

- Single layout support;

- Hardware reset through a push button and reset network;

- Overcurrent and overvoltage input protection through a fuse and schottky diode;

- Electrical Static Discharge (ESD) protection through a discharge net.
