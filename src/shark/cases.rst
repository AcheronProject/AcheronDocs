***************
The Shark Cases
***************

The `case folder of the GitHub repo <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/SharkPCB/tree/master/case>`_ has the .stp, .stl and .f3d files for the custom cases being designed, one being a low profile or "short" (switches are exposed) and another a high-profile or "tall".

.. Attention:: The cases are not ready and were not prototyped; also feedback from the community is still underway so we are still setting on some matters before releasing them.

Why not use Blender?
--------------------

The case was designed in Fusion360, which is not open-source but is freely available. I had a hard time with 3D modelling in Blender, specially because it was not designed to interact with CAD and parts manufacturing; for example, it does not output its files in the STEP format, which is a major problem since that is the standard file extension used in the industry. Ultimately, Blender was not designed for CAD and parts fabrication.

If you want to fork or create a case based on this one, you can check the public links for the `low profile <https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue2d0e419/g/shares/SH7f1edQT22b515c761e412cd5b215194de6?mode=embed&viewState=NoIgbgDAdAjCA0IDeAdEAXAngBwKZoC40ARXAZwEsBzAOzXjQEMyzd1C1cBOAMwgA4AbAGMARgFouuGF3EAWUaNlcATAGYJgiBB4B2ACb6YjflLQBfEAF0gA>`_ and for the `high profile <https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue2d0e419/g/shares/SH7f1edQT22b515c761e0bc166c9ba566c91?mode=embed&viewState=NoIgbgDAdAjCA0IDeAdEAXAngBwKZoC40ARXAZwEsBzAOzXjQEMyzd1C0AWAdgDNOYAJlzcAtBBgxeozhAi5RAIwDGANgDMoxpwCsMNZwAcjdb0NoAviAC6QA>`_ cases. With these links you can download the project files like F3D, STL, STEP and so on.

Mechanical specifications
-------------------------

In order to machine the cases, many factories will need the mechanical drawing of the product to effectively and precisely manufacture it. The Shark case files also contain the mechanical drawings of the cases.
