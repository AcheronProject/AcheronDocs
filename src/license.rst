****************************************
The Acheron Open Hardware License (AOHL)
****************************************

1 Introduction
==============

	This license describes the terms and conditions under which you may use, copy, modify, redistribute the resources hereby published. It also describes how you may make and distribute products based on those project files. It is intended to offer a legal standard by which the authors of these files publish their works, stating their intended use.

1.1 Definitions
---------------

"License" means this AOHL document;

"Resources" mean the Acheron Project design files, hereby published and thoroughly described in section 1.3 of this licence;

"Licensor" means the legal person or people that own, author, create and modify the resources, publishing and distributing it under the conditions of this licence; in this case, the contributors of the Acheron Project, namely Álvaro Augusto Volpato and Felipe Gonçalves Coury;

"Repository" means a location (generally virtual) where any author has placed the resources for public use, and where it is believed the resources will remain publicly available for at least two years;

"Official repository" refers to the repository of the Acheron Project;

"Licensee" means any person that wishes to use the resources, commercially or otherwise, that comply to this licence;

"Product" means parts or the entirety of a device manufactured or built using the resources as published by the licensor or a modified version of those resources.

"Components" means the specific names of the resources in the Acheron Project, namely:

- SharkPCB;
- KeebsPCB;
- ArcticPCB;
- ElevatePCB.

1.2 Guide and intended use
--------------------------

	This license was written to describe how anyone can make use of the files and resources included in the Acheron Project. The basic idea is that all resources can be used, copied, distributed and modified free of charge, commercially or not, under certain basic conditions. These will be explained below to summarize their intent, and will be thoroughly explained through the license.

	- (1.2.1) By using, copying, modifying or distributing the resources hereby licensed, including making products and commercializing them, anyone with access to this license and the resources automatically agree to comply to this licence and its terms, effectively becoming a licensee. Any violation of this licence immediately terminates the rights of the licensee under this licence.

	- (1.2.2) Second, any modifications of the files should be reported back to the licensor once such modifications are made public. This requirement is not a matter of limiting or controlling how the resources should be used, but to keep a spirit of trading: in return for the free use, it is asked that you help the licensor improve the resources.

	- (1.2.3) No warranty is given and liability is limited. No responsibility is taken for faults or losses since the resources here are provided "as is". In this sense, the licensor shall have no liability for damages like economical or data losses. Reestated, the use of the resources is given for free under the discretion of the licensee, and it is the licensee responsibility to properly test and/or prototype all the resources before manufacture or commercial distribution. This condition still applies even if the licensor has already prototyped the resources or parts of them.

	- (1.2.4) The fact that the resources can be copied, modified and redistributed do not mean that the licensor endorses or takes part in the development of other projects that may come from its copying, modifying or redistribution. It also does not imply the transfer or assignment of intellectual property or copyright rights to the licensee;

	- (1.2.5) Let's say that you want to make a project of your own based on one component of the Acheron Project. If the licensor has not taken part on those modifications not endorsed them, it is not reasonable that you can say your project belongs to the Acheron Project, and hence we ask that you remove the Acheron logos, names and web sites listed on the documentation and the resources. If you want your modifications to integrate Acheron, you must submit them to licensor revision (this is generally done through the pull request system) and the licensor must approve the modifications to be submitted to the official repository.

1.3 Resources
-------------

	This licence applies to all the resources published in the documentation, including:

- Printed Circuit Boards ("PCBs"), their schematic diagrams, designs, circuit board layouts and descriptive text;

- The files used for PCBs manufacture like Gerber, SVG and PDF files that describe their mechanical and electrical profiles;

- The Bill of Materials ("BoM"), that describes the components used to manufacture the PCBs, their quantities and models, published in a sheet file or table;

- Parts modelling files like Computer Aided Design ("CAD") and Computer Aided Manufacture ("CAM") files, mechanical drawings and manufacturing, including but not limited to:

	- Keyboard cases;
	- Keyboard plates;
	- Enclosures;
	- Keycap models and drawings;

- Artworks and graphics, such as images and promotional material;

- The descriptive Electronical CAD ("ECAD") or Mechanical CAD ("MCAD") files such as footprints, symbols, shapes, models and drawings, used in conjunction with ECAD/MCAD software to devise the resources;

- This license itself. Although this may sound confusing, Open-Hardware Licenses are still a gray area when it comes to legality, patents, intellectual property. As such, the licenses are constantly evolving and being transformed to attend the market demands. Hence if anyone wishes to use this license, commercially or not, and help make it clearer and more concise, the licensors hereby grant anyone the right to do so, commercially or not, with the single condition that any modifications are reported back to help us improve it.

	This licence does not apply to:

- The software, firmware or code loaded into programmable devices like microprocessors and microcontrollers not endorsed by the licensor. For example, it is perfectly possible that the user wishes to use a third-party firmware in conjunction with the hardware provided in this license; obviously the licensor cannot represent or speak for that firmware, since it was not of their authorship and the use of such firmware is generally subject to proper licensing, terms and conditions;
- The trademarks involved in some components names, brands and logos (for instance, Cortex, ALPS, Cherry, Gateron and so on). All respective brands and logos are proprties of their respective owners; such brands are mentioned only as means of asserting compatibility and usage (for example, "the PCBs use Cortex processors and are compatible with MX-style switches");

2 Applicability
===============

	 This section defines the conditions under which the licensor gives permission to the licensee to use, copy, modify and distribute the resources hereby licensed, including for commercial purposes, given that the licensee complies to the conditions in this section. Such permission is granted by the licensor, directly to the licensee, worlwide and without limitation of time.

2.1 Copying and modification
----------------------------

	The licensor grantes the licensee permission copy and modify the resources, given that:

- (2.1.1) The modified resources must carry legible and clear notices stating the resources were modified, with date and description of the modifications;
- (2.1.2) The licensee makes the modfied resources available at the same level of abstraction than the origina resources
