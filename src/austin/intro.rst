Introduction

Overview
========

The Austin keyboard was designed to have all functionalities of a full-sized keyboard with reduced width. It was a joint project between me, driftingbunnies of DriftingMechanics and PheonixStarr from Nightingale studios.

Mind you that the Group Buy is over, as all 40 units available were sold and there are no further plans as of yet to make a second one.

Features
========

The Austin is a pretty straightforward keyboard, offering little options when it comes to layout.  

Here's a list of the board's features:

- ARM Cortex M0-based STM32F072 processor;

- QMK firmware compatible;

- USBC type connector;

- Supports stepped Caps Lock, split Backspace, split numpad 0, split + key, 7U bottom row and ISO layout;

- Hardware reset through a push button and reset network;

- Overcurrent and overvoltage input protection through a fuse and schottky diode;

- Electrical Static Discharge (ESD) protection through a specialized chip.
