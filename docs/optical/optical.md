## Introduction

The Alexandria Library is the symbol, footprint and 3D models library used on the Acheron Project, its printed circuit boards and documentation. This library is developed using a mixture of some originally-developed footprints and 3D models as well as some others obtained from other places.

### Supported software

Due to the open-source nature of Acheron and Alexandria, its libraries are developed with sole [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) support. As of september 2021, Alexandria is developed using the developmental "nightly" versions of KiCAD; this is because, as part of the version 6.xx roadmap, the KiCAD developers decided to revisit file formats and the library system, which in turn forces Alexandria to comply to the new formats for future-proofing reasons.

This means that in order to use these symbols and footprints **you must update your KiCAD to the latest nightly release**. Since I (Gondolindrim) compile and update KiCAD daily directly from its [official development repository](https://gitlab.com/kicad), always assume the latest version is in use.

For discussion see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/AcheronProject/AlexandriaLibrary/issues/11).

## License

Being a library, it does not make sense to license Alexandria under AOHL since it requires licensees to also open-source derivative works. Hence, Alexandria is released under a much more permissive BSD 3-clause which only requires users to have the same notice in case of redistribution.
