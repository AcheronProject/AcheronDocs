# Technical articles

## Introduction

The intent of publishing these technical articles is to crystallize or solidify certain aspects of PCB design accumulated over the years the Acheron Project has been developed. The general idea of these articles is to expose certain aspects of hardware design in a way acessible and readable for DIY'ers and first-timers.

There is however a problem, which is technicality and detailing *versus* readability. Such articles are meant as explanations and developments of various techniques that sometimes use tools like higher mathematics and embedded engineering that are not so accessible as one might like.

The philosophy of the documentation is then to *expose and explain the matter at hand in a precise and founded way, while achieving the end goal or knowledge in a more accessible form*.
