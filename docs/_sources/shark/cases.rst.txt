The Shark Cases
***************

3D models and prototypes
========================

The `case folder of the SharkHardware repo <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/SharkHardware/tree/master/cases>`_ has the .stp, .stl and .f3d files for the custom cases being designed, one being a low profile or "short" (switches are exposed) and another a high-profile or "tall".

If you want to check the 3D models of the cases, see the `gallery <gallery.html#d-previews-of-the-cases>`_ for in-browser renders.

.. Note:: Both cases were prototyped and are proven to work with the Alpha Release Version of the SharkPCB.

Public links
============

If you want to fork or create a case based on this one, you can check the public links for the `high profile <https://a360.co/2IYRX5x>`_ and for the `low profile <https://a360.co/2ITRhOY>`_ cases. With these links you can download the project files like F3D, STL, STEP and so on.

Download links
==============

The following links can be used to download .stp, .stl and .f3d (Fusion 360 extension) of the cases.

:download:`High Shark STL file <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/SharkHardware/releases/download/V1.0/highShark.stl>` 

:download:`High Shark STP file <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/SharkHardware/releases/download/V1.0/highShark.stp>` 

:download:`Low Shark STL file <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/SharkHardware/releases/download/V1.0/lowShark.stl>` 

:download:`Low Shark STP file <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/SharkHardware/releases/download/V1.0/lowShark.stp>` 

Mechanical specifications
=========================

In order to machine the cases, many factories will need the mechanical drawing of the product to effectively and precisely manufacture it. The Shark case files also contain the mechanical drawings of the cases.

:download:`Click here <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/SharkHardware/releases/download/V1.0/lowSharkMechanicalSpecs.pdf>` to download the mechanical specifications for the Low Shark case.

:download:`Click here <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/SharkHardware/releases/download/V1.0/highSharkMechanicalSpecs.pdf>` to download the mechanical specifications for the High Shark case.

3D previews of the cases
========================

	Below are embedded 3D views of the cases. Beware that they take long enough to load. To see these Embedded Links, you will need to enable WebGL on your browser. On the bottom of the embedded windows there is an options to do full-screen.

	Use the mouse left click to rotate your view and the middle button to pan it. They also work on mobile (I tested it on an Android phone); pan with two fingers and rotate with one.
