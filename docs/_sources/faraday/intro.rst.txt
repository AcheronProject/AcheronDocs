Overview
========

The Faraday PCB was conceived as a take on the Topre swiches for keyboards from the Acheron Project. Topre custom PCBs are pretty much nonexistant in this hobby (apart from some initiatives here and there); this is mainly due to the complicated and difficult to handle capacitive switch technology.

Topre switches work basically by measuring the capacitance difference of a spring-loaded rubber dome system. In this regard, it has always boggled me on how the Leopold FC660C, Realforce and HHKB Pro keyboards implemented the capacitor sensing technology, through a rather complicated and overly sophisticated multiplexation circuitry. The FaradayPCB instead uses an analog capacitance-to-voltage (C2V) analog sensing circuitry, which is detailedly explained in the `principle section <section_>`_

- Alan Pocklington, also known as u/ajp10304, who built a prototype himself and offered to test the preliminary software to hasten the GB and gave immense feedback on documentation and component positioning.
