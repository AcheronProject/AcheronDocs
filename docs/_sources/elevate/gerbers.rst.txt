Gerber and schematic files
**************************

.. Attention:: The `ElevatePCB introduction page <./introduction.html>`_ contains badges to show the last prototyped version of the PCB. Un-prototyped Gerbers will be released as pre-releases in order to prototype them. Always check if the version you are downloading was prototyped!

PCB Gerber files
----------------

:download:`This zipped folder <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/ElevatePCB/raw/master/gerbers/elevatePCB_V1.0.zip>` contains the Gerber files for the last PCB version. Among them are probably more files than needed, including the files for the PCB edges and drill files.

Schematic drawing
-----------------

:download:`This SVG file <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/ElevatePCB/raw/master/gerbers/elevateSchematic_V1.0.svg>` depicts the schematic file of the PCB.
