Introduction

Overview
========

Keebs is an STM32F072-based universal 60% keyboard PCB featuring a single layout and Kailh hotswap sockets. The layout was cherry-picket by MrKeebs himself.

KeebsPCB holds a very special place in my heart as it was one of the first two PCBs in AcheronProject and effectively inaugurated it. It also was the first brazilian initiative to make a custom keyboard PCB and distribute it in the brazilian market.

The pre-revision Alpha of the KeebsPCB was sponsored by `PCBWay <http://www.pcbway.com>`_, a big asian PCB manufacturer that provided prototypes for the Arctic.

The review article can be found at `the AcheronDocs page <https://gondolindrim.github.io/AcheronDocs/pcbway/sponsorship.html>`_.

Features
========

The KeebsPCB is an open-source keyboard PCB featuring limited layouts and compatibility. It also features "universal 60%" mounting holes. Here's a list of the board's features:

- ARM Cortex M4-based STM32F072 processor;

- Kailh hotswap sockets;

- QMK firmware compatible;

- USBC type connector;

- Single layout support: Tsangan bottom row. Also features split right shift, split backspace and stepped caps lock.

- Hardware reset through a push button and reset network;

- Overcurrent and overvoltage input protection through a fuse and schottky diode;

- Electrical Static Discharge (ESD) protection on the USB data lines;

- Surge protection from the metallic case contact.

The idea to make an Open-Source Hardware compliant board was that it could be widely customizable from the start, so anyone could take a KeebsPCB, give their thoughts, feedback and even modify it to their liking. It was designed for that purpose.

In that sense, the Shark uses an STM32 microprocessor that can be programmed in many ways, be it through the QMK firmware, Arduino IDE or any ensemble of software able to flash an STM32.

Also, following the customizable principle, all unused pins were exposed so that the user can add anything hardware-wise he or she wishes.
