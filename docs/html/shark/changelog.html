<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>[<span class="green">Update</span>] <strong>Incorporated feedback</strong>. We incorporated some feedback we got from the IC and GB posts on GeekHack and Reddit.</p></li>
<li><p>[<span class="green">Update</span>] <strong>Added second position for the encoder</strong>. A second position for the Rotary Encoder was added; some users noted that the previous position, bottom left, was where the arrow keys were located and as such this was an important position. So an extra possible position was added, the bottom right. The problem is that this position is where the CTRL key is located, and is also an important position. I deemed it was not worthy to add encoder positions on the top left or right corners, as those are the ESC and BKSPC keys, which are of utmost importance. So this means that it is up to the user where the rotary encoder goes: either bottom left or bottom right. Note that although both positions are offered, <em>the user must choose only one of them, that is, do not use two rotary encoder positions at the same time</em> as this will probably not work because both positions share the same microprocessor pins.</p></li>

<p>Although technically the modifications for this version do not qualify as a new sub-version, the changes were too big to consider them part of the V3.1 series. This is why this new series jumped to V3.2 .</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>[<span class="green">Update</span>] <strong>Tracing overhaul</strong>. There was a general overhaul of the tracing.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>First, around the microprocessor. There were too many dangerous traces, specially near the power pins, that were now removed. This does not mean the previous versions would not work, but it does mean they could be more prone to fabrication defects, specially due to fabrication tolerances;</p></li>
<li><p>Second, around the USB connector. Through hard lessons I learned that one should not trust the solder mask as electrical isolator. The problem was that there were too many traces under the USB connector, presenting potential short-circuits. All those were removed and re-routed outside the connector.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>[<span class="green">Update</span>] <strong>Reassigned of some cols and rows in the MCU</strong>. In order to make possible the re-routing around the microprocessor, some columns and rows were reassigned in the microcontroller:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Row2 and Row1 exchanged places: Row2 was reassigned from pin 39 to pin 38, and Row1 vice-versa;</p></li>
<li><p>EncA and EncB were respectively moved to pins 42 and 43, from 41 and 20;</p></li>
<li><p>Col12 was moved from pin 34 to pin 19; pin 34 is SWDIO and should not be attached to row or column to allow for SWD;</p></li>
<li><p>Col7 and Col8 exchanged places: Col7 was reassigned to pin 14 from 15, and Col8 vice-versa;</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>[<span class="blue">Feature</span>] <strong>Exposed SWD pins</strong>. Even though the STM32F303 being used does have a stock USB DFU bootloader, I took some advice from <strong>pelrun</strong> and exposed the SWD pins anyway. This is done as a backup plan should the user mess up the bootloader and need to reflash it. Pins BOOT0 and NRST were also exposed, just in case they are needed. In order to expose these pins, RGB5 had to be slightly moved.</p></li>
<li><p>[<span class="green">Update</span>] <strong>Renamed some components for clarity</strong>. The CVBus capacitors were renamed to CVB, for clarity. Also C1 and C2 were renamed to CX1 and CX2 to denote they are XTAL load capacitors;</p></li>
<li><p>[<span class="blue">Feature</span>] <strong>Re-implemented ESD inrush current protection</strong>. Incorporated case ESD current inrush protection. This was for three motives:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>In previous versions, the case ESD problem was dealt with by means of a dedicated pad that should be connected to the case via a wire. Then I realized that, being this PCB supposed to be used with tray mount devices, the case and PCB were galvanically conected by the screws, so instead of the dedicated pin I neded only use one of the mounting pads. So I simply connected the ESD discharge net to one of those pads;</p></li>
<li><p>There was a small problem with my past implementation. The ESD net was directly connected to GND, meaning that current could come from the USB connector to the case, provoking an electrical shock to the user. This was dealt with by adding a 1N4007 diode, blocking current from the USB to the case, but allowing the other way around. The choice of component was because this diode has high peak rush current and high reverse voltage – the most needed qualities when ESD is concerned. Nevertheless this diode has two problems. First is it is slow, meaning that, theoretically, in the case of an ESD discharge, the high voltage could spread to the PCB as the diode would not be able to absorb it in time. This should be mitigated by isolating the mounting pads, which are the sites of galvanic connection, from any copper traces. This was done by adding a 1 mm clearance to all those mounting pads. The second problem with the 1N4007 is that it has a rather high forward voltage when compared to more sophisticated alternatives like Schottky diodes. However this may not be a problem, as in an ESD discharge event, involved voltages will most certainly figure among the tenths of volts, if not more, so this problem would not be such a concern. Further testing is required.</p></li>
<li><p>The past implementation also relied on the ground plane to deliver the unwanted inrush current to its proper destination – the USB connector. The problem here is that, in the way the ground copper pour was configured, that inrush current would most certainly need to pass through the microcontroller, which could fry it. The ESD testings in the V3.1.1 prototypes did not yield any damage to the chip, meaning that this hypothetical event is possible but not certain, but it is better to avoid this problem. The new implementation deals with this by delivering the inrush current directly at the connector, avoiding that such current pass through delicate components.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>[<span class="red">Fix</span>] <strong>Fixed potential problems in the reset network</strong>. The reset network used had two issues, pointed out by <strong>ishtob</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>First, the CRST capacitor, which was rated 4.7nF, should actually be 10uF. This problem would cause the high voltage not to be held for long enough, most probably causing a issue in the prototypes where the reset pin needed to be pressed several times before the microcontroller would finally achieve bootloader mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, the transistor used, BC548, did not have a base resistor to bias it. Although it worked fine in the prototypes, this causes a too high of a current on the base-emitter junction, which would probably deteriorate the transistor over time. To fix this two options were available: either insert a discrete resistor between the transistor base and the push button, or use a “self-bias” transistor package, that is, a package that contained a transistor with a resistive net (including a resistor on the base). The latter solution was the one adopted, replacing the BC548 for a DTC123J self-bias transistor.</p></li>

<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>[<span class="green">Update</span>] <strong>Changed some texts for readability</strong>. Some silkscreen texts were changed for more clarity. In the latest prototype (V3.1.6), I used the height value of 0.5mm for the silkscreen character height, which was readable in my opinion but not for Steve – reasonably so. All sikscreen text charaters now should be at least 0.6mm tall and more readable.</p></li>
<li><p>[<span class="green">Update</span>] <strong>Re-positioned RGB5</strong>. The positioning of RGB5 was changed. It was slightly off-centered in version V3.2.0 to accomodate the pins for SWD, BOOT0 and NRST. The LED was now put in its original place, because I realized the pins can be accessed via wires should the user need.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>[<span class="red">Fix</span>] <strong>Fixed DRC “errors”</strong>. When I run the DRC (Design Rule Check) on KiCad, lots of errors pop out. Those are normally due to overlapping holes and pads – a consequence of the multi-layout support, as the holes and pads of close switches will inevitably overlap. The problem is that, this time around, more than 200 error popped out, the majority of them being “Parallel lines being too close” and “Two tracks end too close”. It is a known issue in KiCad that when a trace is “broken”, that is, composed of many traces, these errors will appear. I knew this, but it had never happened to me. There’s a first time to everything I guess. So I redid all traces that had this problem. This is more of an <span class="blue">Update</span> than a fix, because the traces were fine as they were, but I wanted to remove those errors and check them one by one because you never know – some of them could actually be legitimate errors.</p></li>
