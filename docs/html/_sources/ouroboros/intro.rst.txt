Introduction
============

The ouroboros is a discrete Operational Amplifier (OpAmp) directed at high-fidelity audio applications, specially tone control circuitry.

The idea behind the name is that the project be completely modular, in this way the circuits that use this amplifier can be updated by removing the old versions of the amplifier and using new ones that are pin-compatile --- hence the idea of a self-consuming and ever-evolving Ouroboros.
