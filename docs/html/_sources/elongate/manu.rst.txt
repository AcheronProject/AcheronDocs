Manufacturing files
*******************

In the ``./gerbers`` folders you can find the plot files for the PCB.

.. Attention:: Beware that the PCBs are released under a no-warranty and no-liability license, meaning that I cannot guarantee they are fit for a specific purpose. Always check the manufacturing files before ordering their manufacture so that you can be sure they are fit for your purpose. For gerbers I recommend tracespace.io gerbers viewer.

Schematic

:download:`Click here <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/Elongate/raw/master/manuFiles/elongate_schematic.pdf>` for the schematic drawing.

PCB Gerber files
----------------

:download:`This zipped folder <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/Elongate/raw/master/manuFiles/ElongatePCB.zip>` contains the Gerber files for the last PCB version. Among them are probably more files than needed, including the files for the PCB edges and drill files.

.. Attention:: The `ElongatePCB introduction page <./elongate.html>`_ contains badges to show the last prototyped version of the PCB. I will release un-prototyped Gerbers in order to prototype them. Always check if the version you are downloading was prototyped!
