**Steve** from WoodCables. Steve funded the prototypes, is currently running the GB, talked to PCB and case factories. More than this, he gave inumerous design hints and was a part of the design. Without him the Shark would not be possible.

**Gustavo "Undecided Shark" Reinert** was an active part in the design process and named the PCB. I take special pride in this as I gave him his nickname.

**Felipe "MrKeebs" Coury**, the guy whose will to help is second only to his will to spend money on keyboards and stream himself while doing it.

**Raphael "ArcticFox" Hochheim**. The most high-end guy out there, always giving hints and thoughts. The Shark logo positioning and the case format were heavily based on his experience.

**garbo** from GeekHack, who helped immensely in this design by giving me hints and information, always opinating and giving feedback with christian patience. The idea for the mounting hole points were his.

**Walkerstop** also from Geekhack helped by recommendations like using the STM32 family of processors and a USBC connector.

**u/ajp10304** from Reddit. Now this guy read the README and the documentation thoroughly and pointed inconsistencies and errors several times. He gave me good reasons to make a nice documentation and he helped me immensely by this. He also prototyped the Shark in the blue color and was gracious to let me publish the pictures;

**Jack Humbert**, from OLKB, and **ishtob** from the QMK Discord Server. Jack was always very amicable and helpful; the 3D CAD files for the Planck Cases and plate came from the QMK parts Git repo. ishtob was always very accessible and helping with some design questions; in fact, some of the footprints and symbols used were based off of some of his own.

Many people in the Discord server helped with hints, specially **yanfali, Upas** and **MechMerlin**.
