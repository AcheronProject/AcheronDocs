Introduction
============

The **Acheron Project** is a compendium of ECAD and MCAD resources for custom keyboards and audio equipment designed by √Ålvaro "Gondolindrim" Volpato with collaborators (except for some 3D models), that include

- Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs);

- KiCad footprints and symbols;

- Graphic resources like logos;

- 3D models

The aim of the project is to build a database of freely available resources for keyboard enthusiasts and audiophiles, focused primarily on PCBs that comply with Open-Source Hardware principles. Many features, characteristics, components are community-driven and feedback is highly appreciated.

About this documentation
========================

This documentation was built using Sphinx and the ReadTheDocs theme. The source files can be found at the Acheron Project `Github repository <https://github.com/Gondolindrim/AcheronProject>`_.

	The idea behind writing this documentation came from the other collaborators, not me particularly. Truth is I have never imagined that the Acheron Project and its components grew big enough for other people to use it, and hence I needed to document the design process.
