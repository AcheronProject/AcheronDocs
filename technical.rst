These are the technical documents and links that I use for reference on the designs of the Acheron Project.

Guidelines

- Grounding, bypassing and oscillator tracing: `Application Note AVR186 <http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-8128-Best-Practices-for-the-PCB-Layout-of-Oscillators_ApplicationNote_AVR186.pdf>`_ : best practices for the PCB layout of oscillators. Although rather short, this AN contains valuable information on the guidelines and layout of crystal oscillators in MCUs. `This thread <https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/39136/competing-pcb-crystal-layout-recommendations>`_ , specially the response by Olin Lathrop, on the Electronics StackExchange, also contains good information on crystal oscillator tracing and grounding on the PCBs; in the same spirit, the response from the same person in `this tread <https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/15135/decoupling-caps-pcb-layout/15143#15143>`_ contains further more detailed information on the same subject, but also giving good detailed analysis on grounding and bypassing. In the same thread, Mike DeSimone also gives insightful information on these subjects.
